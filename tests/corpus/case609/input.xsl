  <!-- Purpose: Show that the namespace node for an extension namespace is automatically excluded. -->
  <!-- Elaboration: The created element node will also have a copy of the namespace nodes 
       that were present on the element node in the stylesheet tree with the exception 
       of any namespace node whose string-value is the XSLT namespace URI, a namespace 
       URI declared as an extension namespace, or a namespace URI designated as an 
       excluded namespace. -->
