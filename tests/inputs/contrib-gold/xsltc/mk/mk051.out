And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<BR>
Against your honour<BR>
That, with the little godliness I have,<BR>
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,<BR>
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<BR>
That the magnifico is much beloved,<BR>
And hath in his effect a voice potential<BR>
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;<BR>
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance<BR>
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,<BR>
Will give him cable.<BR>

My services which I have done the signiory<BR>
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--<BR>
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,<BR>
I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being<BR>
From men of royal siege, and my demerits<BR>
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<BR>
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,<BR>
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<BR>
I would not my unhoused free condition<BR>
Put into circumscription and confine<BR>
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?<BR>

That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,<BR>
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<BR>
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;<BR>
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.<BR>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<BR>

Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.<BR>

Subdue him at his peril.<BR>
