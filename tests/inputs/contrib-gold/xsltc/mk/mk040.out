      <p>Daisy Ashford (Mrs George Norman) wrote The Young Visiters, a small
         comic masterpiece, while still a young child in Lewes. It was found in a drawer
         in 1919 and sent to Chatto and Windus, who published it in the same year with an
         introduction by J. M. Barrie, who had first insisted on meeting the author in order
         to check that she was genuine.
