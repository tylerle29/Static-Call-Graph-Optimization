      <h1>Song</h1>
      
      <p>
         And suddenly the wind comes soft,<br>
         And Spring is here again;<br>
         And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green<br>
         And my heart with buds of pain.<br>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         My heart all Winter lay so numb,<br>
         The earth so dead and frore,<br>
         That I never thought the Spring would come again<br>
         Or my heart wake any more.<br>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         But Winter's broken and earth has woken,<br>
         And the small birds cry again;<br>
         And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,<br>
         And my heart puts forth its pain.<br>
         
      </p>
